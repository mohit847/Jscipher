// Question: Write a JavaScript function checkFileExists that checks if a file exists asynchronously using promises. The function takes a file path as an argument and returns a promise. Inside the function, after a delay of 1 second, check if the file exists. If the file exists, resolve the promise. If the file does not exist, reject the promise.
// Example Input:checkFileExists('/path/to/file.txt')


// Expected Output:
// A promise object that will be resolved if the file exists after a delay of 1 second. If the file does not exist, the promise should be rejected.
